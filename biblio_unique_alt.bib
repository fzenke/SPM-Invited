abstract	= {For primary auditory cortex (AI) laminae, there is little
		  evidence of functional specificity despite clearly
		  expressed cellular and connectional differences. Natural
		  sounds are dominated by dynamic temporal and spectral
		  modulations and we used these properties to evaluate local
		  functional differences or constancies across laminae. To
		  examine the layer-specific processing of acoustic
		  modulation information, we simultaneously recorded from
		  multiple AI laminae in the anesthetized cat. Neurons were
		  challenged with dynamic moving ripple stimuli and we
		  subsequently computed spectrotemporal receptive fields
		  (STRFs). From the STRFs, temporal and spectral modulation
		  transfer functions (tMTFs, sMTFs) were calculated and
		  compared across layers. Temporal and spectral modulation
		  properties often differed between layers. On average, layer
		  II/III and VI neurons responded to lower temporal
		  modulations than those in layer IV. tMTFs were mainly
		  band-pass in granular layer IV and became more low-pass in
		  infragranular layers. Compared with layer IV, spectral MTFs
		  were broader and their upper cutoff frequencies higher in
		  layers V and VI. In individual penetrations, temporal
		  modulation preference was similar across layers for roughly
		  70\% of the penetrations, suggesting a common, columnar
		  functional characteristic. By contrast, only about 30\% of
		  penetrations showed consistent spectral modulation
		  preferences across layers, indicative of functional laminar
		  diversity or specialization. Since local laminar
		  differences in stimulus preference do not always parallel
		  the main flow of information in the columnar cortical
		  microcircuit, this indicates the influence of additional
		  horizontal or thalamocortical inputs. AI layers that
		  express differing modulation properties may serve distinct
		  roles in the extraction of dynamic sound information, with
		  the differing information specific to the targeted stations
		  of each layer.},

		  responses to logarithmic FM sweep stimuli in the primary

		  implanted array of microelectrodes we quantitatively
		  characterized neuronal responses to FM sweeps and to random
		  tone-pip stimuli. Tone-pip responses were used to construct
		  spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs). Classification of
		  FM sweep responses revealed few neurons with high direction
		  and speed selectivity. Most neurons responded to sweeps in
		  both directions and over a broad range of sweep speeds.
		  Characteristic frequency estimates from FM responses were
		  highly correlated with estimates from STRFs, although
		  spectral receptive field bandwidth was consistently
		  underestimated by FM stimuli. Predictions of FM direction
		  selectivity and best speed from STRFs were significantly
		  correlated with observed FM responses, although some
		  systematic discrepancies existed. Last, the population
		  distributions of FM responses in the awake owl monkey were
		  similar to, although of longer temporal duration than,

@Article{Belitski_etal08_low-loca,
abstract	= {Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect subthreshold
		  integrative processes that complement spike train measures.
		  However, little is yet known about the differences between
		  how LFPs and spikes encode rich naturalistic sensory
		  stimuli. We addressed this question by recording LFPs and
		  spikes from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized
		  macaques while presenting a color movie. We then determined
		  how the power of LFPs and spikes at different frequencies
		  represents the visual features in the movie. We found that
		  the most informative LFP frequency ranges were 1-8 and
		  60-100 Hz. LFPs in the range of 12-40 Hz carried little
		  information about the stimulus, and may primarily reflect
		  neuromodulatory inputs. Spike power was informative only at
		  frequencies <12 Hz. We further quantified "signal
		  correlations" (correlations in the trial-averaged power
		  response to different stimuli) and "noise correlations"
		  (trial-by-trial correlations in the fluctuations around the
		  average) of LFPs and spikes recorded from the same
		  electrode. We found positive signal correlation between
		  high-gamma LFPs (60-100 Hz) and spikes, as well as strong
		  positive signal correlation within high-gamma LFPs,
		  suggesting that high-gamma LFPs and spikes are generated
		  within the same network. LFPs <24 Hz shared strong positive
		  noise correlations, indicating that they are influenced by
		  a common source, such as a diffuse neuromodulatory input.
		  LFPs <40 Hz showed very little signal and noise
		  correlations with LFPs >40 Hz and with spikes, suggesting
		  that low-frequency LFPs reflect neural processes that in
		  natural conditions are fully decoupled from those giving
		  rise to spikes and to high-gamma LFPs.},

@Article{Beyeler_etal16_3dvisu,
abstract	= {Neurons in the dorsal subregion of the medial superior
		  temporal (MSTd) area of the macaque respond to large,
		  complex patterns of retinal flow, implying a role in the
		  analysis of self-motion. Some neurons are selective for the
		  expanding radial motion that occurs as an observer moves
		  through the environment
		  ({\textquotedblleft}heading{\textquotedblright}), and
		  computational models can account for this finding. However,
		  ample evidence suggests that MSTd neurons exhibit a
		  continuum of visual response selectivity to large-field
		  motion stimuli. Furthermore, the underlying computational
		  principles by which these response properties are derived
		  remain poorly understood. Here we describe a computational
		  model of macaque MSTd based on the hypothesis that neurons
		  in MSTd efficiently encode the continuum of large-field
		  retinal flow patterns on the basis of inputs received from
		  neurons in MT with receptive fields that resemble basis
		  vectors recovered with non-negative matrix factorization.
		  These assumptions are sufficient to quantitatively simulate
		  neurophysiological response properties of MSTd cells, such
		  as 3D translation and rotation selectivity, suggesting that
		  these properties might simply be a byproduct of MSTd
		  neurons performing dimensionality reduction on their
		  inputs. At the population level, model MSTd accurately
		  predicts eye velocity and heading using a sparse
		  distributed code, consistent with the idea that biological
		  MSTd might be well equipped to efficiently encode various
		  self-motion variables. The present work aims to add some
		  structure to the often contradictory findings about macaque
		  MSTd, and offers a biologically plausible account of a wide
		  range of visual response properties ranging from
		  single-unit selectivity to population
		  statistics.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Using a dimensionality
		  reduction technique known as non-negative matrix
		  factorization, we found that a variety of medial superior
		  temporal (MSTd) neural response properties could be derived
		  from MT-like input features. The responses that emerge from
		  this technique, such as 3D translation and rotation
		  selectivity, spiral tuning, and heading selectivity, can
		  account for a number of empirical results. These findings
		  (1) provide a further step toward a scientific
		  understanding of the often nonintuitive response properties
		  of MSTd neurons; (2) suggest that response properties, such
		  as complex motion tuning and heading selectivity, might
		  simply be a byproduct of MSTd neurons performing
		  dimensionality reduction on their inputs; and (3) imply
		  that motion perception in the cortex is consistent with
		  ideas from the efficient-coding and free-energy principles.},

abstract	= {Electrophysiological studies in mammal primary auditory
		  cortex have demonstrated neuronal tuning and cortical
		  spatial organization based upon spectral and temporal
		  qualities of the stimulus including: its frequency,
		  intensity, amplitude modulation and frequency modulation.
		  Although communication and other behaviourally relevant
		  sounds are usually complex, most response characterizations
		  have used tonal stimuli. To better understand the
		  mechanisms necessary to process complex sounds, we
		  investigated neuronal responses to a specific class of
		  broadband stimuli, auditory gratings or ripple stimuli, and
		  compared the responses with single tone responses. Ripple
		  stimuli consisted of 150-200 frequency components with the
		  intensity of each component adjusted such that the envelope
		  of the frequency spectrum is sinusoidal. It has been
		  demonstrated that neurons are tuned to specific
		  characteristics of those ripple stimulus including the
		  intensity, the spacing of the peaks, and the location of
		  the peaks and valleys (C. E. Schreiner and B. M. Calhoun,
		  Auditory Neurosci., 1994; 1: 39-61). Although previous
		  results showed that neuronal response strength varied with
		  the intensity and the fundamental frequency of the
		  stimulus, it is shown here that the relative response to
		  different ripple spacings remains essentially constant with
		  changes in the intensity and the fundamental frequency.
		  These findings support a close relationship between
		  pure-tone receptive fields and ripple transfer functions.
		  However, variations of other stimulus characteristics, such
		  as spectral modulation depth, result in non-linear
		  alterations in the ripple transformation. The processing
		  between the basilar membrane and the primary auditory
		  cortex of broadband stimuli appears generally to be
		  non-linear, although specific stimulus qualities, including
		  the phase of the spectral envelope, are processed in a
		  nearly linear manner.},

		  asymmetric window, recent studies have also revealed
		  several layers of complexity in STDP, including its
		  dependence on dendritic location, the nonlinear integration
		  of synaptic modification induced by complex spike trains,
		  and the modulation of STDP by inhibitory and
		  neuromodulatory inputs. Finally, the functional
		  consequences of STDP have been examined directly in an
		  increasing number of neural circuits in vivo.},

@Article{Depireux_etal01_specresp,
abstract	= {To understand the neural representation of broadband,
		  dynamic sounds in primary auditory cortex (AI), we
		  characterize responses using the spectro-temporal response
		  field (STRF). The STRF describes, predicts, and fully
		  characterizes the linear dynamics of neurons in response to
		  sounds with rich spectro-temporal envelopes. It is computed
		  from the responses to elementary "ripples," a family of
		  sounds with drifting sinusoidal spectral envelopes. The
		  collection of responses to all elementary ripples is the
		  spectro-temporal transfer function. The complex
		  spectro-temporal envelope of any broadband, dynamic sound
		  can expressed as the linear sum of individual ripples.
		  Previous experiments using ripples with downward drifting
		  spectra suggested that the transfer function is separable,
		  i.e., it is reducible into a product of purely temporal and
		  purely spectral functions. Here we measure the responses to
		  upward and downward drifting ripples, assuming reparability
		  within each direction, to determine if the total
		  bidirectional transfer function is fully separable. In
		  general, the combined transfer function for two directions
		  is not symmetric, and hence units in AI are not, in
		  general, fully separable. Consequently, many AI units have
		  complex response properties such as sensitivity to
		  direction of motion, though most inseparable units are not
		  strongly directionally selective. We show that for most
		  neurons, the lack of full separability stems from
		  differences between the upward and downward spectral
		  cross-sections but not from the temporal cross-sections;
		  this places strong constraints on the neural inputs of
		  these AI units.},

abstract	= {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to the finding that
		  targets at cued locations are responded to more slowly than
		  targets at uncued locations when a relatively long temporal
		  interval occurs between the two events. In studies which
		  have examined the time course of IOR (e.g., Samuel \& Kat
		  in Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 10, 897-906, 2003), the
		  effect is generally shown to develop at around 200 ms and
		  dissipate at around 3,000 ms following a cue. A number of
		  recent studies, however, have demonstrated that IOR can
		  develop much more quickly (up to 50 ms following a cue) and
		  last much longer (up to 13 min following a cue) in certain
		  tasks. The present study uses the multiple cuing paradigm
		  to determine whether IOR can be observed outside the
		  normally reported temporal boundaries (300-3,000 ms) when
		  attention is shifted very quickly (every 15 ms) or very
		  slowly (every 1,500 ms) throughout the visual field. IOR
		  was observed as quickly as 30 ms following cue onset and as
		  long as 6,000 ms following cue onset. Implications for the
		  role of IOR in visual search are discussed.},

		  attention. Such research rests upon the assumption that
		  similar mechanisms underlie attention in both species.
		  Here, we directly compare the influence of low-level
		  stimulus features on overt attention in monkeys and humans
		  under natural conditions. We recorded eye-movements in
		  humans and rhesus monkeys during free-viewing of natural
		  images. We find that intrinsic low-level features, such
		  luminance-contrast, texture-contrast and saliency as
		  predicted by a standard model, are elevated at fixation
		  points in the majority of images. These correlative effects
		  are not significantly different between species. However,
		  local image modifications affect both species differently:
		  moderate modifications, which are in the range of natural
		  fluctuations, attract overt attention in monkeys
		  significantly stronger than they do in humans. In addition,
		  humans show a higher inter-individual consistency regarding
		  which locations they fixate than monkeys, in spite of the
		  similarity for intrinsic low-level features. Taken
		  together, these data demonstrate that under natural
		  conditions low-level stimulus features affect attention in
		  monkeys and humans differently.},

abstract	= {1. Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields
		  was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the
		  responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose
		  luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally
		  about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive
		  fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be
		  approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells)
		  summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge
		  frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly
		  increased when grating patterns drifted across their
		  receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation
		  between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting
		  sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response
		  was measured. In every case it was found that the
		  reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity
		  function, could be satisfactorily described by the
		  difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding
		  supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the
		  antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of
		  ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian
		  functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way
		  in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge
		  pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the
		  receptive field centre was determined and found to be
		  consistent with the cell's measured contrast sensitivity
		  function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced
		  changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell
		  which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions
		  of the receptive field increased while the surround region
		  became relatively ineffective.},

abstract	= {The antennal lobe plays a central role for odor processing
		  in insects, as demonstrated by electrophysiological and
		  imaging experiments. Here we analyze the detailed temporal
		  evolution of glomerular activity patterns in the antennal
		  lobe of honeybees. We represent these spatiotemporal
		  patterns as trajectories in a multidimensional space, where
		  each dimension accounts for the activity of one glomerulus.
		  Our data show that the trajectories reach odor-specific
		  steady states (attractors) that correspond to stable
		  activity patterns at about 1 second after stimulus onset.
		  As revealed by a detailed mathematical investigation, the
		  trajectories are characterized by different phases:
		  response onset, steady-state plateau, response offset, and
		  periods of spontaneous activity. An analysis based on
		  support-vector machines quantifies the odor specificity of
		  the attractors and the optimal time needed for odor
		  discrimination. The results support the hypothesis of a
		  spatial olfactory code in the antennal lobe and suggest a
		  perceptron-like readout mechanism that is biologically
		  implemented in a downstream network, such as the mushroom
		  body.},

@Article{Ferrera_Lisberger95_attetarg,
abstract	= {Two rhesus monkeys were trained to track a small moving
		  target in the presence of a moving distractor. The target
		  and distractor were distinguished by their color. Smooth
		  pursuit eye movements were quantified in terms of the
		  latency of the eye movement and the open-loop eye
		  acceleration profile. Smooth pursuit latencies for single
		  targets were on the order of 100 msec. When the target was
		  paired with a distractor moving in the same direction as
		  the target, pursuit latencies decreased to roughly 85 msec.
		  When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the
		  opposite direction, pursuit latencies increased to roughly
		  150 msec. The motion of the distractor had no significant
		  effect on the eye acceleration profile. Experiments were
		  performed to dissociate visual search for the target from
		  pursuit initiation by providing a spatial cue rather than
		  the color cue. These experiments showed that visual search
		  necessarily preceded pursuit initiation only when the
		  distractor moved in the opposite direction relative to the
		  target. In this case, visual search contributed about 25
		  msec to the overall latency of pursuit. Control experiments
		  showed that the monkey need not attend to the distractor in
		  order for it to influence the latency of pursuit. A network
		  model was developed in which units that represent the
		  motions of the target and distractor compete against one
		  another. Attention serves to bias the outcome of this
		  competition toward the direction of the selected target.
		  The performance of this network exhibits a striking
		  parallel to the effect of the distractor on smooth pursuit
		  latency.},

		  An additional regulatory mechanism is required to extend
		  the learning capability to more complex and natural

abstract	= {We demonstrate bistable attractor dynamics in a spiking
		  neural network implemented with neuromorphic {VLSI}
		  hardware. The on-chip network consists of three interacting
		  populations (two excitatory, one inhibitory) of
		  integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. One excitatory population
		  is distinguished by strong synaptic self-excitation, which
		  sustains meta-stable states of 'high' and 'low'-firing
		  activity. Depending on the overall excitability,
		  transitions to the 'high' state may be evoked by external
		  stimulation, or may occur spontaneously due to random
		  activity fluctuations. In the former case, the 'high' state
		  retains a 'working memory' of a stimulus until well after
		  its release. In the latter case, 'high' states remain
		  stable for seconds, three orders of magnitude longer than
		  the largest time-scale implemented in the circuitry. Evoked
		  and spontaneous transitions form a continuum and may
		  exhibit a wide range of latencies, depending on the
		  strength of external stimulation and of recurrent synaptic
		  excitation. In addition, we investigated 'corrupted' 'high'
		  states comprising neurons of both excitatory populations.
		  Within a 'basin of attraction', the network dynamics
		  'corrects' such states and re-establishes the prototypical
		  'high' state. We conclude that, with effective theoretical
		  guidance, full-fledged attractor dynamics can be realized
		  with comparatively small populations of neuromorphic
		  hardware neurons.},

abstract	= {The squirrel monkey twitter call is an exemplar of a broad
		  class of species-specific vocalizations that contain
		  naturally voiced frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. To
		  investigate how this prominent communication call element
		  is represented in primary auditory cortex (AI), neuronal
		  receptive field properties to pure-tone and synthetic,
		  logarithmically spaced FM-sweep stimuli in 3
		  barbiturate-anesthetized squirrel monkeys are studied.
		  Responses to pure tones are assessed by using standard
		  measures of frequency response areas, whereas responses to
		  FM sweeps are classified according to direction
		  selectivity, best speed, and speed tuning preferences. Most
		  neuronal clusters respond to FM sweeps in both directions
		  and over a range of FM speeds. Center frequencies
		  calculated from the average of high and low trigger
		  frequency edges of FM response profiles are highly
		  correlated with pure-tone characteristic frequencies (CFs).
		  However, bandwidth estimates are only weakly correlated
		  with their pure-tone counterparts. CF and direction
		  selectivity are negatively correlated. Best speed maps
		  reveal idiosyncratically positioned spatial aggregation of
		  similar values. In contrast, direction selectivity maps
		  show unambiguous spatial organization. Neuronal clusters
		  selective for upward-directed FM sweeps are located in
		  ventral-caudal AI, where CFs range from 0.5 to 1 kHz.
		  Combinations of pure-tone and FM response parameters form 2
		  significant factors to account for response variations.
		  These results are interpreted in the context of earlier FM
		  investigations and neuronal encoding of dynamic sounds.},

abstract	= {Recent work in field of neuroprosthetics has demonstrated
		  that by observing the simultaneous activity of many neurons
		  in specific regions of the brain, it is possible to produce
		  control signals that allow animals or humans to drive
		  cursors or prosthetic limbs directly through thoughts. As
		  neuroprosthetic devices transition from experimental to
		  clinical use, there is a need for fully-implantable
		  amplification and telemetry electronics in close proximity
		  to the recording sites. To address these needs, we
		  developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless
		  neural recording from a 100-channel microelectrode array.
		  The design of both the system-level architecture and the
		  individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints
		  for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue
		  by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to
		  the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the
		  system must perform data reduction as well. We use a
		  combination of a low-power ADC and an array of "spike
		  detectors" to reduce the transmitted data rate while
		  preserving critical information. The complete system
		  receives power and commands (at 6.5 kb/s) wirelessly over a
		  2.64-MHz inductive link and transmits neural data back at a
		  data rate of 330 kb/s using a fully-integrated 433-MHz FSK
		  transmitter. The 4.7times5.9 mm2 chip was fabricated in a
		  0.5-mum 3M2P CMOS process and consumes 13.5 mW of power.
		  While cross-chip interference limits performance in
		  single-chip operation, a two-chip system was used to record
		  neural signals from a Utah Electrode Array in cat cortex
		  and transmit the digitized signals wirelessly to a
		  receiver},

		  commercially-available 1.5 /spl mu/m, 2-metal, 2-poly CMOS
		  process that occupies approximately 91,000 square /spl
		  mu/m. We report circuit characteristics for a 1.5 V power
		  supply, suitable for single cell battery operation. In one
		  specific configuration, the circuit bandpass filters the
		  incoming signal from 22 Hz to 6.7 kHz while providing a
		  gain of 42.5 dB. With an amplifier power consumption of 0.8

abstract	= {Humans spend a lot of time searching for things, such as
		  roadside traffic signs1, soccer balls2 or tumours in
		  mammograms3. These tasks involve the deployment of
		  attention from one item in the visual field to the next.
		  Common sense suggests that rejected items should be noted
		  in some fashion so that effort is not expended in
		  re-examining items that have been attended to and rejected.
		  However, common sense is wrong. Here we asked human
		  observers to search for a letter 'T' among letters 'L'.
		  This search demandsvisual attention and normally proceeds
		  at a rate of 20-30 milliseconds per item4. In the critical
		  condition, we randomly relocated all letters every 111
		  milliseconds. This made it impossible for the subjects to
		  keep track of the progress of the search. Nevertheless, the
		  efficiency of the search was unchanged. Theories of visual
		  search all assume that search relies on accumulating
		  information about the identity of objects over time5-7.
		  Such theories predict that search efficiency will be
		  drastically reduced if the scene is continually shuffled
		  while the observer is trying to search through it. As we
		  show that efficiency is not impaired, the standard theories
		  must be revised.},

abstract	= {Rather than attempting to fully interpret visual scenes in
		  a parallel fashion, biological systems appear to employ a
		  serial strategy by which an attentional spotlight rapidly
		  selects circumscribed regions in the scene for further
		  analysis. The spatiotemporal deployment of attention has
		  been shown to be controlled by both bottom-up (image-based)
		  and top-down (volitional) cues. We describe a detailed
		  neuromimetic computer implementation of a bottom-up scheme
		  for the control of visual attention, focusing on the
		  problem of combining information across modalities
		  (orientation, intensity, and color information) in a purely
		  stimulus-driven manner. We have applied this model to a
		  wide range of target detection tasks, using synthetic and
		  natural stimuli. Performance has, however, remained
		  difficult to objectively evaluate on natural scenes,
		  because no objective reference was available for
		  comparison. We present predicted search times for our model
		  on the Search\_2 database of rural scenes containing a
		  military vehicle. Overall, we found a poor correlation
		  between human and model search times. Further analysis,
		  however, revealed that in 75\% of the images, the model
		  appeared to detect the target faster than humans (for
		  comparison, we calibrated the model's arbitrary internal
		  time frame such that 2 to 4 image locations were visited
		  per second). It seems that this model, which had originally
		  been designed not to find small, hidden military vehicles,
		  but rather to find the few most obviously conspicuous
		  objects in an image, performed as an efficient target
		  detector on the Search\_2 dataset. Further developments of
		  the model are finally explored, in particular through a
		  more formal treatment of the difficult problem of
		  extracting suitable low-level features to be fed into the
		  saliency map.},

		  for understanding the mechanisms of behavior. Nowhere is
		  this more obvious than in the nematode <italic>C.
		  elegans</italic>, where the nearly complete connectome has
		  been available for over 25 years yet little is known about
		  the neural basis of most of its behavior. Here we combine
		  known neuroanatomical constraints from the <italic>C.
		  elegans</italic> connectome with a simplified body and
		  environment, and use optimization techniques to fill in the
		  missing electrophysiological parameters in plausible ways
		  so as to produce worm-like behavior. We focus on one
		  spatial orientation behavior, where the reactions to
		  sensory input depend on the worm's internal state at the
		  time of the stimulus: salt klinotaxis. By exploring the
		  possibilities for what is unknown in ways that are
		  consistent with what is known, we generate an ensemble of
		  hypotheses about the neural basis of this behavior.
		  Studying the structure of this ensemble, we formulate new
		  experiments that can distinguish between the various
		  hypotheses. This methodology is likely to accelerate the
		  discovery and understanding of the biological circuitry
		  underlying the behavior of interest, before a complete
		  electrophysiological characterization is available.</p>},

abstract	= {<p>Complex sequencing rules observed in birdsongs provide
		  an opportunity to investigate the neural mechanism for
		  generating complex sequential behaviors. To relate the
		  findings from studying birdsongs to other sequential
		  behaviors such as human speech and musical performance, it
		  is crucial to characterize the statistical properties of
		  the sequencing rules in birdsongs. However, the properties
		  of the sequencing rules in birdsongs have not yet been
		  fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the
		  statistical properties of the complex birdsong of the
		  Bengalese finch (<italic>Lonchura striata var.
		  domestica</italic>). Based on manual-annotated syllable
		  labeles, we first show that there are significant
		  higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese finch songs,
		  that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than
		  one previous syllable. We then analyze acoustic features of
		  the song and show that higher-order context dependencies
		  can be explained using first-order hidden state transition
		  dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model
		  corresponds to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known
		  statistical models with a large range of application for
		  time series modeling. The song annotation with these models
		  with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with
		  manual annotation, the score was comparable to that of a
		  second-order HMM, and surpassed the zeroth-order model (the
		  Gaussian mixture model; GMM), which does not use context
		  information. Our results imply that the hierarchical
		  representation with hidden state dynamics may underlie the
		  neural implementation for generating complex behavioral
		  sequences with higher-order dependencies.</p>},

abstract	= {Our nervous system is confronted with a barrage of sensory
		  stimuli, but neural resources are limited and not all
		  stimuli can be processed to the same extent. Mechanisms
		  exist to bias attention toward the particularly salient
		  events, thereby providing a weighted representation of our
		  environment [1]. Our understanding of these mechanisms is
		  still limited, but theoretical models can replicate such a
		  weighting of sensory inputs and provide a basis for
		  understanding the underlying principles [2 and 3]. Here, we
		  describe such a model for the auditory system--an auditory
		  saliency map. We experimentally validate the model on
		  natural acoustical scenarios, demonstrating that it
		  reproduces human judgments of auditory saliency and
		  predicts the detectability of salient sounds embedded in
		  noisy backgrounds. In addition, it also predicts the
		  natural orienting behavior of naive macaque monkeys to the
		  same salient stimuli. The structure of the suggested model
		  is identical to that of successfully used visual saliency
		  maps. Hence, we conclude that saliency is determined either
		  by implementing similar mechanisms in different unisensory
		  pathways or by the same mechanism in multisensory areas. In
		  any case, our results demonstrate that different primate
		  sensory systems rely on common principles for extracting
		  relevant sensory events.},

abstract	= {Subjects performed a concurrent smooth pursuit and
		  perceptual task to determine whether smooth pursuit eye
		  movements and perception share the same attentional
		  mechanism. Subjects pursued a pair of eccentric rows of
		  moving characters while simultaneously attempting to
		  identify and locate the single numeral in these target rows
		  and the single numeral in a pair of untracked background
		  rows, which moved at a different velocity. Average smooth
		  pursuit gain (eye velocity/target velocity) was 0.7 to 1.
		  Visual search was better for target rows (~ 65\% correct)
		  than for background rows (~ 22\% correct). Superior search
		  performance for the target was not due to its lower retinal
		  speed: performance on the target was 2-3 times better than
		  on the background when retinal speeds were the same.
		  Superior performance for the pursuit target suggests that
		  smooth eye movements and perception share the same
		  selective attentional mechanism. A shared attentional
		  mechanism was further supported by findings that subjects
		  could not: (1) maintain a stable line of sight on a central
		  stationary point while simultaneously attending to moving
		  rows; and (2) pursue one pair of rows and attend the other,
		  untracked rows. Attempts to attend untracked rows did,
		  however, produce a partial improvement in search
		  performance which was accompanied by only a very slight
		  change in eye velocity. This demonstrates that the effects
		  of decisions about how to apportion attention across the
		  visual field depend on the task. Despite the common
		  selective attentional mechanism, smooth eye movements do
		  not provide accurate external indicators of attention
		  unless the consequences of attentional decisions for
		  performance are determined separately for oculomotor and
		  for perceptual tasks.},

abstract	= {Immediately following an event at a peripheral location
		  there is facilitation for the processing of other stimuli
		  near that location. This is said to reflect a reflexive
		  shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. After
		  attention is removed from such a peripheral location, there
		  is then delayed responding to stimuli subsequently
		  displayed there. This inhibitory aftereffect, first
		  described in 1984 and later labeled 'inhibition of return
		  (IOR)', encourages orienting towards novel locations and
		  hence might facilitate foraging and other search behaviors.
		  Since its relatively recent discovery, IOR has been the
		  subject of intensive investigation, from many angles and
		  with a wide variety of approaches. After describing the
		  seminal contribution of Posner and Cohen ("Who"), this
		  review will discuss what causes IOR and, once initiated,
		  what effects IOR has on subsequent processing ("What"). The
		  time course ("When") and spatial distribution ("Where") of
		  IOR, and what is known about IOR's neural implementation
		  ("How") and functional significance ("Why") are also
		  discussed.},

@Article{Kowalski_etal96_analdyna,
abstract	= {1. Responses of single units and multiunit clusters were
		  recorded in the ferret primary auditory cortex (AI) with
		  the use of broadband complex dynamic spectra. Previous work
		  has demonstrated that simpler spectra consisting of single
		  moving ripples (i.e., sinusoidally modulated spectral
		  profiles that travel at a constant velocity along the
		  logarithmic frequency axis) could be used effectively to
		  characterize the response fields and transfer functions of
		  AI cells. 2. A complex dynamic spectral profile can be
		  thought of as being the sum of moving ripple spectra. Such
		  a decomposition can be computed from a two-dimensional
		  spectrotemporal Fourier transform of the dynamic spectral
		  profile with moving ripples as the basis function. 3.
		  Therefore, if AI units were essentially linear, satisfying
		  the superposition principle, then their responses to
		  arbitrary dynamic spectra could be predicted from the
		  responses to single moving ripples, i.e., from the units'
		  response fields and transfer functions (spectral and
		  temporal impulse response functions, respectively). 4. This
		  conjecture was tested and confirmed with data from 293
		  combinations of moving ripples, involving complex spectra
		  composed of up to 15 moving ripples of different ripple
		  frequencies and velocities. For each case, response
		  predictions based on the unit transfer functions were
		  compared with measured responses. The correlation between
		  predicted and measured responses was found to be
		  consistently high (84\% with rho > 0.6). 5. The
		  distribution of response parameters suggests that AI cells
		  may encode the profile of a dynamic spectrum by performing
		  a multiscale spectrotemporal decomposition of the dynamic
		  spectral profile in a largely linear manner.},

abstract	= {Bio-inspired asynchronous event-based vision sensors are
		  currently introducing a paradigm shift in visual
		  information processing. These new sensors rely on a
		  stimulus-driven principle of light acquisition similar to
		  biological retinas. They are event-driven and fully
		  asynchronous, thereby reducing redundancy and encoding
		  exact times of input signal changes, leading to a very
		  precise temporal resolution. Approaches for higher-level
		  computer vision often rely on the reliable detection of
		  features in visual frames, but similar definitions of
		  features for the novel dynamic and event-based visual input
		  representation of silicon retinas have so far been lacking.
		  This article addresses the problem of learning and
		  recognizing features for event-based vision sensors, which
		  capture properties of truly spatiotemporal volumes of
		  sparse visual event information. A novel computational
		  architecture for learning and encoding spatiotemporal
		  features is introduced based on a set of predictive
		  recurrent reservoir networks, competing via winner-take-all
		  selection. Features are learned in an unsupervised manner
		  from real-world input recorded with event-based vision
		  sensors. It is shown that the networks in the architecture
		  learn distinct and task-specific dynamic visual features,
		  and can predict their trajectories over time.},

abstract	= {Shifting attention away from a visual stimulus reduces,
		  but does not abolish, visual discrimination performance.
		  This residual vision with 'poor' attention can be compared
		  to normal vision with 'full' attention to reveal how
		  attention alters visual perception. We report large
		  differences between residual and normal visual thresholds
		  for discriminating the orientation or spatial frequency of
		  simple patterns, and smaller differences for discriminating
		  contrast. A computational model, in which attention
		  activates a winner-take-all competition among overlapping
		  visual filters, quantitatively accounts for all
		  observations. Our model predicts that the effects of
		  attention on visual cortical neurons include increased
		  contrast gain as well as sharper tuning to orientation and
		  spatial frequency.},

		  neurons might be engaged by a task, which is important to
		  know if we are to understand how cortex encodes
		  information. For human cortex, I estimate the cost of
		  individual spikes, then, from the known energy consumption
		  of cortex, I establish how many neurons can be active
		  concurrently. The cost of a single spike is high, and this
		  severely limits, possibly to fewer than 1\%, the number of
		  neurons that can be substantially active concurrently. The
		  high cost of spikes requires the brain not only to use
		  representational codes that rely on very few active
		  neurons, but also to allocate its energy resources flexibly
		  among cortical regions according to task demand. The latter
		  constraint explains the investment in local control of
		  hemodynamics, exploited by functional magnetic resonance
		  imaging, and the need for mechanisms of selective

		  processing such as the iterative decoding of turbo codes,
		  LDPC codes and similar codes, joint decoding, equalization,
		  parameter estimation, hidden-Markov models, Kalman
		  filtering, and recursive least squares. Graphical models
		  can represent complex real-world systems, and such
		  representations help to derive practical
		  detection/estimation algorithms in a wide area of
		  applications. Most known signal processing techniques
		  -including gradient methods, Kalman filtering, and particle
		  methods -can be used as components of such algorithms.
		  Other than most of the previous literature, we have used
		  Forney-style factor graphs, which support hierarchical
		  modeling and are compatible with standard block diagrams.},

abstract	= {Our eyes move continually, even while we fixate our gaze
		  on an object. If fixational eye movements are counteracted,
		  our perception of stationary objects fades completely, due
		  to neural adaptation. Some studies have suggested that
		  fixational microsaccades refresh retinal images, thereby
		  preventing adaptation and fading. However, other studies
		  disagree, and so the role of microsaccades remains unclear.
		  Here, we correlate visibility during fixation to the
		  occurrence of microsaccades. We asked subjects to indicate
		  when Troxler fading of a peripheral target occurs, while
		  simultaneously recording their eye movements with high
		  precision. We found that before a fading period, the
		  probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades
		  decreased. Before transitions toward visibility, the
		  probability, rate, and magnitude of microsaccades
		  increased. These results reveal a direct link between
		  suppression of microsaccades and fading and suggest a
		  causal relationship between microsaccade production and
		  target visibility during fixation.},

abstract	= {Experimental studies have observed Long Term synaptic
		  Potentiation (LTP) when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly
		  before a postsynaptic neuron, and Long Term Depression
		  (LTD) when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after, a
		  phenomenon known as Spike Timing Dependant Plasticity
		  (STDP). When a neuron is presented successively with
		  discrete volleys of input spikes STDP has been shown to
		  learn 'early spike patterns', that is to concentrate
		  synaptic weights on afferents that consistently fire early,
		  with the result that the postsynaptic spike latency
		  decreases, until it reaches a minimal and stable value.
		  Here, we show that these results still stand in a
		  continuous regime where afferents fire continuously with a
		  constant population rate. As such, STDP is able to solve a
		  very difficult computational problem: to localize a
		  repeating spatio-temporal spike pattern embedded in equally
		  dense 'distractor' spike trains. STDP thus enables some
		  form of temporal coding, even in the absence of an explicit
		  time reference. Given that the mechanism exposed here is
		  simple and cheap it is hard to believe that the brain did
		  not evolve to use it.},

abstract	= {We investigated the hypothesis that neurons encode rich
		  naturalistic stimuli in terms of their spike times relative
		  to the phase of ongoing network fluctuations rather than
		  only in terms of their spike count. We recorded local field
		  potentials (LFPs) and multiunit spikes from the primary
		  visual cortex of anaesthetized macaques while binocularly
		  presenting a color movie. We found that both the spike
		  counts and the low-frequency LFP phase were reliably
		  modulated by the movie and thus conveyed information about
		  it. Moreover, movie periods eliciting higher firing rates
		  also elicited a higher reliability of LFP phase across
		  trials. To establish whether the LFP phase at which spikes
		  were emitted conveyed visual information that could not be
		  extracted by spike rates alone, we compared the Shannon
		  information about the movie carried by spike counts to that
		  carried by the phase of firing. We found that at low LFP
		  frequencies, the phase of firing conveyed 54\% additional
		  information beyond that conveyed by spike counts. The extra
		  information available in the phase of firing was crucial
		  for the disambiguation between stimuli eliciting high spike
		  rates of similar magnitude. Thus, phase coding may allow
		  primary cortical neurons to represent several effective
		  stimuli in an easily decodable format.},

abstract	= {When a stimulus supports two distinct interpretations,
		  perception alternates in an irregular manner between them.
		  What causes the bistable perceptual switches remains an
		  open question. Most existing models assume that switches
		  arise from a slow fatiguing process, such as adaptation or
		  synaptic depression. We develop a new, attractor-based
		  framework in which alternations are induced by noise and
		  are absent without it. Our model goes beyond previous
		  energy-based conceptualizations of perceptual bistability
		  by constructing a neurally plausible attractor model that
		  is implemented in both firing rate mean-field and spiking
		  cell-based networks. The model accounts for known
		  properties of bistable perceptual phenomena, most notably
		  the increase in alternation rate with stimulation strength
		  observed in binocular rivalry. Furthermore, it makes a
		  novel prediction about the effect of changing stimulus
		  strength on the activity levels of the dominant and
		  suppressed neural populations, a prediction that could be
		  tested with functional MRI or electrophysiological
		  recordings. The neural architecture derived from the
		  energy-based model readily generalizes to several competing
		  populations, providing a natural extension for
		  multistability phenomena.},

@Article{Ohzawa_etal85_contgain,
abstract	= {We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical
		  neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is
		  functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may
		  have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of
		  adjustments that center a limited response range around a
		  mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we
		  measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate
		  cortex while systematically adapting them to different
		  contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of
		  cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic
		  experiment show that contrast-response functions shift
		  laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response
		  functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This
		  implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the
		  cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this
		  process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this
		  contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to
		  cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type
		  (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain
		  control is almost certainly a cortical function, since
		  lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal
		  effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37)
		  provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the
		  process. In another series of experiments, the effect of
		  contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast
		  sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast
		  levels as low as 3\% was capable of nearly doubling the
		  thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may
		  therefore be an important factor in determinations of the
		  contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the
		  spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these
		  gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using
		  both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that
		  portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory
		  discharges could be elicited directly (the central
		  discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive
		  property of the central region. This held even in the case
		  of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences
		  from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we
		  measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found
		  the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of
		  approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable
		  variability in this value from cell to cell.},

		  neurons. One of these methods is an iterative,
		  continuous-time estimation algorithm for a network
		  likelihood model formulated in terms of multiplicative
		  conditional intensity functions. We devised a discrete-time
		  version of this algorithm that includes a new, efficient
		  computational strategy, a principled method to compute
		  starting values, and a principled stopping criterion. In an
		  analysis of simulated neural spike trains from ensembles of
		  interacting neurons, the algorithm recovered the correct
		  connectivity matrices and interaction parameters. In the
		  analysis of spike trains from an ensemble of rat
		  hippocampal place cells, the algorithm identified a
		  connectivity matrix and interaction parameters consistent
		  with the pattern of conjoined firing predicted by the
		  overlap of the neurons' spatial receptive fields. These
		  results suggest that the network likelihood model can be an
		  efficient tool for the analysis of ensemble spiking
		  activity.},

abstract	= {Visual attention is the ability to rapidly detect the
		  visually salient parts of a given scene. Inspired by
		  biological vision, the saliency-based algorithm efficiently
		  models the visual attention process. Due to its complexity,
		  the saliency-based model of visual attention needs, for a
		  real time implementation, higher computation resources than
		  available in conventional processors. This work reports a
		  real time implementation of this attention model on a
		  highly parallel Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
		  architecture called ProtoEye. Tailored for low-level image
		  processing, ProtoEye consists of a 2D array of mixed
		  analog-digital processing elements (PE). The operations
		  required for visual attention computation are optimally
		  distributed on the analog and digital parts. The analog
		  diffusion network is used to implement the spatial
		  filtering-based transformations such as the conspicuity
		  operator and the competitive normalization of conspicuity
		  maps. Whereas the digital part of ProtoEye allows the
		  implementation of logical and arithmetical operations, for
		  instance, the integration of the normalized conspicuity
		  maps into the final saliency map. Using gray level images,
		  the on ProtoEye implemented attention process operates in
		  real-time. It runs at a frequency of 14 images per
		  second.},

abstract	= {Recent research [Parkhurst, D., Law, K., \& Niebur, E.,
		  2002. Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of
		  overt visual attention. Vision Research 42 (1) (2002)
		  107-123] showed that a model of bottom-up visual attention
		  can account in part for the spatial locations fixated by
		  humans while free-viewing complex natural and artificial
		  scenes. That study used a definition of salience based on
		  local detectors with coarse global surround inhibition.
		  Here, we use a similar framework to investigate the roles
		  of several types of non-linear interactions known to exist
		  in visual cortex, and of eccentricity-dependent processing.
		  For each of these, we added a component to the salience
		  model, including richer interactions among orientation-
		  tuned units, both at spatial short range (for clutter
		  reduction) and long range (for contour facilitation), and a
		  detailed model of eccentricity-dependent changes in visual
		  processing. Subjects free-viewed naturalistic and
		  artificial images while their eye movements were recorded,
		  and the resulting fixation locations were compared with the
		  models' predicted salience maps. We found that the proposed
		  interactions indeed play a significant role in the
		  spatiotemporal deployment of attention in natural scenes;
		  about half of the observed inter-subject variance can be
		  explained by these different models. This suggests that
		  attentional guidance does not depend solely on local visual
		  features, but must also include the effects of interactions
		  among features. As models of these interactions become more
		  accurate in predicting behaviorally-relevant salient
		  locations, they become useful to a range of applications in
		  computer vision and human-machine interface design.},

abstract	= {We introduce a framework for decision making in which the
		  learning of decision making is reduced to its simplest and
		  biologically most plausible form: Hebbian learning on a
		  linear neuron. We cast our Bayesian-Hebb learning rule as
		  reinforcement learning in which certain decisions are
		  rewarded and prove that each synaptic weight will on
		  average converge exponentially fast to the log-odd of
		  receiving a reward when its pre- and postsynaptic neurons
		  are active. In our simple architecture, a particular action
		  is selected from the set of candidate actions by a
		  winner-take-all operation. The global reward assigned to
		  this action then modulates the update of each synapse.
		  Apart from this global reward signal, our reward-modulated
		  Bayesian Hebb rule is a pure Hebb update that depends only
		  on the coactivation of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons,
		  not on the weighted sum of all presynaptic inputs to the
		  postsynaptic neuron as in the perceptron learning rule or
		  the Rescorla-Wagner rule. This simple approach to
		  action-selection learning requires that information about
		  sensory inputs be presented to the Bayesian decision stage
		  in a suitably preprocessed form resulting from other
		  adaptive processes (acting on a larger timescale) that
		  detect salient dependencies among input features. Hence our
		  proposed framework for fast learning of decisions also
		  provides interesting new hypotheses regarding neural nodes
		  and computational goals of cortical areas that provide
		  input to the final decision stage.},

abstract	= {Visual search is a fundamental and routine task of
		  everyday life. Studying visual search promises to shed
		  light on the basic attentional mechanisms that facilitate
		  visual processing. To investigate visual attention during
		  search processes, numerous studies measured the selectivity
		  of observers' saccadic eye movements for local display
		  features. These experiments almost entirely relied on
		  simple, artificial displays with discrete search items and
		  features. The present study employed complex search
		  displays and targets to examine task-driven (top-down)
		  visual guidance by low-level features under more natural
		  conditions. Significant guidance by local intensity,
		  contrast, spatial frequency, and orientation was found, and
		  its properties such as magnitude and resolution were
		  analyzed across dimensions. Moreover, feature-ratio effects
		  were detected, which correspond to distractor-ratio effects
		  in simple search displays. These results point out the
		  limitations of current purely stimulus-driven (bottom-up)
		  models of attention during scene perception.},

abstract	= {In the last few decades several concepts of dynamical
		  systems theory (DST) have guided psychologists, cognitive
		  scientists, and neuroscientists to rethink about sensory
		  motor behavior and embodied cognition. A critical step in
		  the progress of DST application to the brain (supported by
		  modern methods of brain imaging and multi-electrode
		  recording techniques) has been the transfer of its initial
		  success in motor behavior to mental function, i.e.,
		  perception, emotion, and cognition. Open questions from
		  research in genetics, ecology, brain sciences, etc., have
		  changed DST itself and lead to the discovery of a new
		  dynamical phenomenon, i.e., reproducible and robust
		  transients that are at the same time sensitive to
		  informational signals. The goal of this review is to
		  describe a new mathematical framework heteroclinic
		  sequential dynamics to understand self-organized activity
		  in the brain that can explain certain aspects of robust
		  itinerant behavior. Specifically, we discuss a hierarchy of
		  coarse-grain models of mental dynamics in the form of
		  kinetic equations of modes. These modes compete for
		  resources at three levels: (i) within the same modality,
		  (ii) among different modalities from the same family (like
		  perception), and (iii) among modalities from different
		  families (like emotion and cognition). The analysis of the
		  conditions for robustness, i.e., the structural stability
		  of transient (sequential) dynamics, give us the possibility
		  to explain phenomena like the finite capacity of our
		  sequential working memory a vital cognitive function , and
		  to find specific dynamical signatures different kinds of
		  instabilities of several brain functions and mental

abstract	= {We investigated whether it is possible to infer spike
		  trains solely on the basis of the underlying local field
		  potentials (LFPs). Using support vector machines and linear
		  regression models, we found that in the primary visual
		  cortex (V1) of monkeys, spikes can indeed be inferred from
		  LFPs, at least with moderate success. Although there is a
		  considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the
		  low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms
		  range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas
		  exact spike positions are not reliably predicted. Two kinds
		  of features of the LFP are exploited for prediction: the
		  frequency power of bands in the high {gamma}-range (40-90
		  Hz) and information contained in low-frequency oscillations
		  (<10 Hz), where both phase and power modulations are
		  informative. Information analysis revealed that both
		  features code (mainly) independent aspects of the
		  spike-to-LFP relationship, with the low-frequency LFP phase
		  coding for temporally clustered spiking activity. Although
		  both features and prediction quality are similar during
		  seminatural movie stimuli and spontaneous activity,
		  prediction performance during spontaneous activity degrades
		  much more slowly with increasing electrode distance. The
		  general trend of data obtained with anesthetized animals is
		  qualitatively mirrored in that of a more limited data set
		  recorded in V1 of non-anesthetized monkeys. In contrast to
		  the cortical field potentials, thalamic LFPs (e.g., LFPs
		  derived from recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate
		  nucleus) hold no useful information for predicting spiking
		  activity.},

@Article{Rodriguez-Fernandez_etal06_novemeta,
abstract	= {BACKGROUND:We consider the problem of parameter estimation
		  (model calibration) in nonlinear dynamic models of
		  biological systems. Due to the frequent ill-conditioning
		  and multi-modality of many of these problems, traditional
		  local methods usually fail (unless initialized with very
		  good guesses of the parameter vector). In order to surmount
		  these difficulties, global optimization (GO) methods have
		  been suggested as robust alternatives. Currently,
		  deterministic GO methods can not solve problems of
		  realistic size within this class in reasonable computation
		  times. In contrast, certain types of stochastic GO methods
		  have shown promising results, although the computational
		  cost remains large. Rodriguez-Fernandez and coworkers have
		  presented hybrid stochastic-deterministic GO methods which
		  could reduce computation time by one order of magnitude
		  while guaranteeing robustness. Our goal here was to further
		  reduce the computational effort without loosing
		  robustness.RESULTS:We have developed a new procedure based
		  on the scatter search methodology for nonlinear
		  optimization of dynamic models of arbitrary (or even
		  unknown) structure (i.e. black-box models). In this
		  contribution, we describe and apply this novel
		  metaheuristic, inspired by recent developments in the field
		  of operations research, to a set of complex identification
		  problems and we make a critical comparison with respect to
		  the previous (above mentioned) successful
		  methods.CONCLUSION:Robust and efficient methods for
		  parameter estimation are of key importance in systems
		  biology and related areas. The new metaheuristic presented
		  in this paper aims to ensure the proper solution of these
		  problems by adopting a global optimization approach, while
		  keeping the computational effort under reasonable values.
		  This new metaheuristic was applied to a set of three
		  challenging parameter estimation problems of nonlinear
		  dynamic biological systems, outperforming very
		  significantly all the methods previously used for these
		  benchmark problems.},

abstract	= {We frequently reposition our gaze by making rapid
		  ballistic eye movements that are called saccades. Saccades
		  pose problems for the visual system, because they generate
		  rapid, large-field motion on the retina and change the
		  relationship between the object position in external space
		  and the image position on the retina. The brain must ignore
		  the one and compensate for the other. Much progress has
		  been made in recent years in understanding the effects of
		  saccades on visual function and elucidating the mechanisms
		  responsible for them. Evidence suggests that saccades
		  trigger two distinct neural processes: (1) a suppression of
		  visual sensitivity, specific to the magnocellular pathway,
		  that dampens the sensation of motion and (2) a gross
		  perceptual distortion of visual space in anticipation of
		  the repositioning of gaze. Neurophysiological findings from
		  several laboratories are beginning to identify the neural
		  substrates involved in these effects.},

abstract	= {<title>Author Summary</title><p>Memory is critical to
		  virtually all aspects of behavior, which may explain why
		  memory is such a complex phenomenon involving numerous
		  interacting mechanisms that operate across multiple brain
		  regions. Many of these mechanisms cooperate to transform
		  initially fragile memories into more permanent ones (memory
		  consolidation). The process of memory consolidation starts
		  at the level of individual synaptic connections, but it
		  ultimately involves circuit reorganization in multiple
		  brain regions. We show that there is a computational
		  advantage in partitioning memory systems into subsystems
		  that operate on different timescales. Individual subsystems
		  cannot both store large amounts of information about new
		  memories, and, at the same time, preserve older memories
		  for long periods of time. Subsystems with highly plastic
		  synapses (fast subsystems) are good at storing new memories
		  but bad at retaining old ones, whereas subsystems with less
		  plastic synapses (slow subsystems) can preserve old
		  memories but cannot store detailed new memories. Here we
		  propose a model of a multi-stage memory system that
		  exhibits the good features of both its fast and its slow
		  subsystems. Our model incorporates some of the important
		  design principles of any memory system and allows us to
		  interpret in a new way what we know about brain
		  memory.</p>},

@Article{Rutkowski_Weinberger05_encolear,
abstract	= {We hypothesized that learning-induced representational
		  expansion in the primary auditory cortex (AI) directly
		  encodes the degree of behavioral importance of a sound.
		  Rats trained on an operant auditory conditioning task were
		  variably motivated to the conditioned stimulus (CS) through
		  different levels of water deprivation. Mean performance
		  values correlated with deprivation level, validating them
		  as a measure of the overall control and, therefore,
		  behavioral importance of the CS. Electrophysiological
		  mapping revealed expanded representations of the CS,
		  compared with other frequencies in experimental subjects,
		  but not in naive or visually trained controls that received
		  noncontingent CS tones. Importantly, representational area
		  showed a significant positive correlation with mean
		  performance levels for only the CS band, with significant
		  effects for relative area in contrast to only modest
		  changes in absolute area. CS representational expansion was
		  asymmetric into high-frequency zones, thus performance
		  level also was significantly correlated with the relative
		  anterior-posterior location of the enlarged representation.
		  An increased representation of low frequencies, related to
		  the acoustic spectrum of the reward delivery equipment,
		  also was discovered in both experimental and control
		  trained subjects, supporting the conclusion that
		  behaviorally important sounds gain representational area.
		  Furthermore, there was a surprising reduction in total AI
		  area for the experimental and control groups, compared with
		  untrained naive subjects, indicating that the functional
		  dimensions of AI are not fixed. Overall, the findings
		  support the encoding of acquired stimulus importance based
		  on representational size in AI.},

abstract	= {Learning in a neuronal network is often thought of as a
		  linear superposition of synaptic modifications induced by
		  individual stimuli. However, since biological synapses are
		  naturally bounded, a linear superposition would cause fast
		  forgetting of previously acquired memories. Here we show
		  that this forgetting can be avoided by introducing
		  additional constraints on the synaptic and neural dynamics.
		  We consider Hebbian plasticity of excitatory synapses. A
		  synapse is modified only if the postsynaptic response does
		  not match the desired output. With this learning rule, the
		  original memory performances with unbounded weights are
		  regained, provided that (1) there is some global
		  inhibition, (2) the learning rate is small, and (3) the
		  neurons can discriminate small differences in the total
		  synaptic input (e.g., by making the neuronal threshold
		  small compared to the total postsynaptic input). We prove
		  in the form of a generalized perceptron convergence theorem
		  that under these constraints, a neuron learns to classify
		  any linearly separable set of patterns, including a wide
		  class of highly correlated random patterns. During the
		  learning process, excitation becomes roughly balanced by
		  inhibition, and the neuron classifies the patterns on the
		  basis of small differences around this balance. The fact
		  that synapses saturate has the additional benefit that
		  nonlinearly separable patterns, such as similar patterns
		  with contradicting outputs, eventually generate a
		  subthreshold response, and therefore silence neurons that
		  cannot provide any information.},

abstract	= {In this paper we review several ways of realizing
		  asynchronous Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) using
		  memristors as synapses. Our focus is on how to use
		  individual memristors to implement synaptic weight
		  multiplications, in a way such that it is not necessary to
		  (a) introduce global synchronization and (b) to separate
		  memristor learning phases from memristor performing phases.
		  In the approaches described, neurons fire spikes
		  asynchronously when they wish and memristive synapses
		  perform computation and learn at their own pace, as it
		  happens in biological neural systems. We distinguish
		  between two different memristor physics, depending on
		  whether they respond to the original ``moving wall'' or to
		  the ``filament creation and annihilation'' models.
		  Independent of the memristor physics, we discuss two
		  different types of STDP rules that can be implemented with
		  memristors: either the pure timing-based rule that takes
		  into account the arrival time of the spikes from the pre-
		  and the post-synaptic neurons, or a hybrid rule that takes
		  into account only the timing of pre-synaptic spikes and the
		  membrane potential and other state variables of the
		  post-synaptic neuron. We show how to implement these rules
		  in cross-bar architectures that comprise massive arrays of
		  memristors, and we discuss applications for artificial
		  vision.},

abstract	= {A spiking neural network model is described for learning
		  to discriminate among spatial patterns in an unsupervised
		  manner. The network anatomy consists of source neurons that
		  are activated by external inputs, a reservoir that
		  resembles a generic cortical layer with an
		  excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network and a sink layer of
		  neurons for readout. Synaptic plasticity in the form of
		  STDP is imposed on all the excitatory and inhibitory
		  synapses at all times. While long-term excitatory STDP
		  enables sparse and efficient learning of the salient
		  features in inputs, inhibitory STDP enables this learning
		  to be stable by establishing a balance between excitatory
		  and inhibitory currents at each neuron in the network. The
		  synaptic weights between source and reservoir neurons form
		  a basis set for the input patterns. The neural trajectories
		  generated in the reservoir due to input stimulation and
		  lateral connections between reservoir neurons can be
		  readout by the sink layer neurons. This activity is used
		  for adaptation of synapses between reservoir and sink layer
		  neurons. A new measure called the discriminability index
		  (DI) is introduced to compute if the network can
		  discriminate between old patterns already presented in an
		  initial training session. The DI is also used to compute if
		  the network adapts to new patterns without losing its
		  ability to discriminate among old patterns. The final
		  outcome is that the network is able to correctly
		  discriminate between all patterns???both old and new. This
		  result holds as long as inhibitory synapses employ STDP to
		  continuously enable current balance in the network. The
		  results suggest a possible direction for future
		  investigation into how spiking neural networks could
		  address the stability-plasticity question despite having
		  continuous synaptic plasticity.},

abstract	= {A spiking neural network model is described for learning
		  to discriminate among spatial patterns in an unsupervised
		  manner. The network anatomy consists of source neurons that
		  are activated by external inputs, a reservoir that
		  resembles a generic cortical layer with an
		  excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network and a sink layer of
		  neurons for readout. Synaptic plasticity in the form of
		  STDP is imposed on all the excitatory and inhibitory
		  synapses at all times. While long-term excitatory STDP
		  enables sparse and efficient learning of the salient
		  features in inputs, inhibitory STDP enables this learning
		  to be stable by establishing a balance between excitatory
		  and inhibitory currents at each neuron in the network. The
		  synaptic weights between source and reservoir neurons form
		  a basis set for the input patterns. The neural trajectories
		  generated in the reservoir due to input stimulation and
		  lateral connections between reservoir neurons can be
		  readout by the sink layer neurons. This activity is used
		  for adaptation of synapses between reservoir and sink layer
		  neurons. A new measure called the discriminability index
		  (DI) is introduced to compute if the network can
		  discriminate between old patterns already presented in an
		  initial training session. The DI is also used to compute if
		  the network adapts to new patterns without losing its
		  ability to discriminate among old patterns. The final
		  outcome is that the network is able to correctly
		  discriminate between all patterns???both old and new. This
		  result holds as long as inhibitory synapses employ STDP to
		  continuously enable current balance in the network. The
		  results suggest a possible direction for future
		  investigation into how spiking neural networks could
		  address the stability-plasticity question despite having
		  continuous synaptic plasticity.},

@Article{Srinivasan_etal96_honenavi,
abstract	= {Recent research has uncovered a number of different ways
		  in which bees use cues derived from optic flow for
		  navigational purposes. The distance flown to a food source
		  is gauged by integrating the apparent motion of the visual
		  world that is experienced en route. In other words, bees
		  possess a visually driven 'odometer' that is robust to
		  variations in wind load and energy expenditure. Bees flying
		  through a tunnel maintain equidistance to the flanking
		  walls by balancing the apparent speeds of the images of the
		  walls. This strategy enables them to negotiate narrow
		  passages or to fly between obstacles. The speed of flight
		  in a tunnel is controlled by holding constant the average
		  image velocity as seen by the two eyes. This avoids
		  potential collisions by ensuring that the bee slows down
		  when flying through narrow passages. Bees landing on a
		  horizontal surface hold constant the image velocity of the
		  surface as they approach it. This automatically ensures
		  that flight speed decreases with altitude and is close to
		  zero at touchdown. The movement-sensitive mechanisms
		  underlying these various behaviours seem to be different,
		  qualitatively as well as quantitatively, from those
		  mediating the well-investigated optomotor response.},

abstract	= {Neuromorphic Vision sensors have improved greatly since
		  the first silicon retina was presented almost three decades
		  ago. They have recently matured to the point where they are
		  commercially available and can be operated by laymen.
		  However, despite improved availability of sensors, there
		  remains a lack of good datasets, while algorithms for
		  processing spike-based visual data are still in their
		  infancy. On the other hand, frame-based computer vision
		  algorithms are far more mature, thanks in part to widely
		  accepted datasets which allow direct comparison between
		  algorithms and encourage competition. We are presented with
		  a unique opportunity to shape the development of
		  Neuromorphic Vision benchmarks and challenges by leveraging
		  what has been learnt from the use of datasets in
		  frame-based computer vision. Taking advantage of this
		  opportunity, in this paper we review the role that
		  benchmarks and challenges have played in the advancement of
		  frame-based computer vision, and suggest guidelines for the
		  creation of Neuromorphic Vision benchmarks and challenges.
		  We also discuss the unique challenges faced when
		  benchmarking Neuromorphic Vision algorithms, particularly
		  when attempting to provide direct comparison with
		  frame-based computer vision.},

abstract	= {What distinguishes the locations that we fixate from those
		  that we do not? To answer this question we recorded eye
		  movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and
		  recorded image characteristics centred at the locations
		  that observers fixated. To investigate potential
		  differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus
		  non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to
		  make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content
		  explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic
		  techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to
		  those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge
		  information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance
		  or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more
		  distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of
		  low frequency luminance information were avoided. With
		  prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations
		  between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D.
		  J., Law, K., \& Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of
		  salience in the allocation of overt visual attention.
		  Vision Research, 42 (1), 107-123] we found no change in the

		  an unchanging intermediate level representation of the

abstract	= {Inhibition of return (IOR) refers to slower reaction times
		  (RTs) to targets that occur in the same, rather than in a
		  diVerent, location as a preceding onset cue. The present
		  study examined IOR for expected (likely) and unexpected
		  (unlikely) targets under conditions in which stimulus'
		  response (S-R) expectancies were generated on a
		  trial-by-trial basis or maintained across a block of
		  trials. Three boxes were aligned along the vertical
		  midline. In Experiments 1 and 2, the appearance of a cue in
		  the upper or lower box was a signal to generate an
		  expectancy about the most likely color of an impending
		  discrimination target. In Experiment 3, one target color
		  was more likely than another across a block of trials. In
		  all cases, cue location did not predict target location.
		  When S-R expectancies were generated on a trial-by-trial
		  basis, IOR occurred for Unlikely targets but not for Likely
		  targets; this was true across a range of cue-target
		  stimulus onset asynchronies. In contrast, when S-R
		  expectancies were maintained over a block of trials, IOR
		  was larger for Likely than for Unlikely targets. These
		  Wndings reveal a critical interaction of S-R expectancies
		  with IOR. This interaction not only demonstrates the
		  modulation of IOR by cognitive expectancies, but in doing
		  so also provides evidence that is consistent with the view
		  that IOR reXects a conservative response bias.},

abstract	= {Models of attention and saccade target selection propose
		  that within the brain there is a topographic map of visual
		  salience that combines bottom-up and top-down influences to
		  identify locations for further processing. The results of a
		  series of experiments with monkeys performing visual search
		  tasks have identified a population of frontal eye field
		  (FEF) visually responsive neurons that exhibit all of the
		  characteristics of a visual salience map. The activity of
		  these FEF neurons is not sensitive to specific features of
		  visual stimuli; but instead, their activity evolves over
		  time to select the target of the search array. This
		  selective activation reflects both the bottom-up intrinsic
		  conspicuousness of the stimuli and the top-down knowledge
		  and goals of the viewer. The peak response within FEF
		  specifies the target for the overt gaze shift. However, the
		  selective activity in FEF is not in itself a motor command
		  because the magnitude of activation reflects the relative
		  behavioral significance of the different stimuli in the
		  visual scene and occurs even when no saccade is made.
		  Identifying a visual salience map in FEF validates the
		  theoretical concept of a salience map in many models of
		  attention. In addition, it strengthens the emerging view
		  that FEF is not only involved in producing overt gaze
		  shifts, but is also important for directing covert spatial
		  attention.},

@Article{Uchizawa_etal06_comppowe,
abstract	= {Circuits composed of threshold gates (McCulloch-Pitts
		  neurons, or perceptrons) are simplified models of neural
		  circuits with the advantage that they are theoretically
		  more tractable than their biological counterparts. However,
		  when such threshold circuits are designed to perform a
		  specific computational task, they usually differ in one
		  important respect from computations in the brain: they
		  require very high activity. On average every second
		  threshold gate fires (sets a 1 as output) during a
		  computation. By contrast, the activity of neurons in the
		  brain is much sparser, with only about 1\% of neurons
		  firing. This mismatch between threshold and neuronal
		  circuits is due to the particular complexity measures
		  (circuit size and circuit depth) that have been minimized
		  in previous threshold circuit constructions. In this
		  letter, we investigate a new complexity measure for
		  threshold circuits, energy complexity, whose minimization
		  yields computations with sparse activity. We prove that all
		  computations by threshold circuits of polynomial size with
		  entropy O(log n) can be restructured so that their energy
		  complexity is reduced to a level near the entropy of
		  circuit states. This entropy of circuit states is a novel
		  circuit complexity measure, which is of interest not only
		  in the context of threshold circuits but for circuit
		  complexity in general. As an example of how this measure
		  can be applied, we show that any polynomial size threshold
		  circuit with entropy O(log n) can be simulated by a
		  polynomial size threshold circuit of depth 3. Our results
		  demonstrate that the structure of circuits that result from
		  a minimization of their energy complexity is quite
		  different from the structure that results from a
		  minimization of previously considered complexity measures,
		  and potentially closer to the structure of neural circuits
		  in the nervous system. In particular, different pathways
		  are activated in these circuits for different classes of
		  inputs. This letter shows that such circuits with sparse
		  activity have a surprisingly large computational power.},

@Article{Ye_etal10_synamech,
abstract	= {Frequency modulation (FM) is a prominent feature in animal
		  vocalization and human speech. Although many neurons in the
		  auditory cortex are known to be selective for FM direction,
		  the synaptic mechanisms underlying this selectivity are not
		  well understood. Previous studies of both visual and
		  auditory neurons have suggested two general mechanisms for
		  direction selectivity: (1) differential delays of
		  excitatory inputs across the spatial/spectral receptive
		  field and (2) spatial/spectral offset between excitatory
		  and inhibitory inputs. In this study, we have examined the
		  contributions of both mechanisms to FM direction
		  selectivity in rat primary auditory cortex. The excitatory
		  and inhibitory synaptic inputs to each cortical neuron were
		  measured by in vivo whole-cell recording. The
		  spectrotemporal receptive field of each type of inputs was
		  mapped with random tone pips and compared with direction
		  selectivity of the neuron measured with FM stimuli. We
		  found that both the differential delay of the excitatory
		  input and the spectral offset between excitation and
		  inhibition are positively correlated with direction
		  selectivity of the neuron. Thus, both synaptic mechanisms
		  are likely to contribute to FM direction selectivity in the
		  auditory cortex. Finally, direction selectivity measured
		  from the spiking output is significantly stronger than that
		  based on the subthreshold membrane potentials, indicating
		  that the selectivity is further sharpened by the spike
		  generation mechanism.},
